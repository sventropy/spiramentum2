## Hey, that's a Flutter app, what about Android?

Yes, this is a flutter app but it intended for iOS only!

## What does "Spiramentum" mean?

Ask [wikipedia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spiramentum)

## Where can I find Spiramentum 1?

I've built this app a couple of times in Swift, SwiftUI, Xamarin.Forms and Flutter to get a feeling
of the different frameworks and approaches. I ended up with Flutter because it is easy to learn
and "works". SwiftUI on the other hand is too buggy and I have spent too much time with Swift and 
Xamarin. So long story short, this app has (at least) earned major version number 2. 

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
